    """
    Implements a custom metaclass used for accessing
    configuration data by simply accessing class attributes.
    Supports getting configuration from up to two levels
    of nested configuration through `section` and `subsection`.
    `section` specifies the YAML configuration section (or "key")
    in which the configuration lives, and must be set.
    `subsection` is an optional attribute specifying the section
    within the section from which configuration should be loaded.
    Example Usage:
        # config.yaml
        bot:
            prefixes:
                direct_message: ''
                guild: '!'
        # config.py
        class Prefixes(metaclass=YAMLGetter):
            section = "bot"
            subsection = "prefixes"
        # Usage in Python code
        from config import Prefixes
        def get_prefix(bot, message):
            if isinstance(message.channel, PrivateChannel):
